# The Dice People

This project is for my first milestone project: User-Centric Frontend Development with Code Institute.

The website address is https://eleanorpro.github.io/milestoneproject1/index.html

I created a website for a fictional board game cafe in Whitley Bay. 
The wesite includes a list of events, information on the location and opening times of the cafe and the prices for table and game hire. It also includes a contact form to get in touch.


## UX

The website is aimed at customers and potential customers. It gives basic information about the cafe and uses images to convey that a primary reason to visit is to play board games. It also shows that the cafe is also a place to go and have a drink. 
I have attended a board game cafe locally which does not have a website, so I thought about what kind of things I would want to see if they did have one. I also visited their Facebook Page and had a look at other board game cafe websites which I found on Google. This enabled me to see what kind of information they thought customers found important.
I designed the website to be simple, providing the basic information needed to a potential customer and provide a contact form in case they want to know more. The page includes examples of some of the board games available.

The website includes the main page giving information to anyone visiting, this clarifies the type of cafe it is, and gives information on upcoming events which may be important to a regular customer who is wanting to check what is happening. 
The about page shows where it is located, when it is open and gives information about the cost of hiring a table or attending events. All of this will help a customer who is intending on visiting. 
We provided information to the customer that hot drinks, food and alcoholic drinks can be purchased, as well as confirming we provide for vegan and gluten free customers. A contact page is also included where customers can ask questions or book a table. 

### Strategy

The main goal was to ensure the website was accessible to all customers and designed in a way that they will be able to find any information they may need. 
All content is relevant to a customer. I asked other board gamers what information they would want and expect to see on a board game cafe website so I could be sure to implement everything that would be important.

### Scope

I decided what was most important based on my strategy, and decided to commit to those features. I have included a section below on features which may be implemented in the future.

### Structure

The same type of heading is used across the website to make it clear where users can find information.
Pictures are included, and scale, or are removed completely from smaller devices. 

### Skeleton

The navigation bar is standard across each page of the website so that a user can access each page in the same way on every page. This is also a standard which other websites use so that a user will expect the links to be where they are. 
Social media links are included at the bottom of the page in the footer. On a desktop, these will change colour when hovered over. These links are not as important as the main information on the site, which is why they are in the footer, however they are available and easy to see and recognise if a customer wants to use them for more information.

### Surface

The order of the pages are in order of importance. The home page tells users the purpose of the cafe, information and events. If a user wants to know more or visit, they can use the next link to visit the about page which includes all information needed for someone who wishes to visit. If there is anything else they would like to know, the final link will enable them to enquire directly.
I have avoided using too many bright colours so that all audiences can use the website without feeling overwhelmed or anxious. The content is well spaced so that it doesnt look too busy. 


## Features to implement in the future

I would add a menu in the future. I would also add a more detailled booking system so a customer can select a date, view availibility and book the table directly. As most customers will not book a table in advance, a more general contact form is suitable for the moment.
I would link the website up with BoardGameGeek.com showing exactly what games are available to play in the cafe so that customers can view the games we have. 
Also I would include photos of the games displays and images of inside the cafe. 


## Technologies used

I created the website using HTML5 and CSS3. 
[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) was used to style the webpage.
Fonts used were from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
The map was from [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/).
Icons used were from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).


## Testing

I tested the website using Google Dev Tools to view the page as it would be on various devices, specifically phones, tablets and desktops. This also ensured the content was well spaced and positioned on each device. During testing, I identified that the opening hours were squashed on a smaller device. I fixed this by using media queries so that the images are only shown on a desktop or laptop. Adding padding to the table also helped it look clearer across all devices.
The welcome text across the main image of the homepage also did not scale down well and the edges would not be visable. I removed the text on smaller devices as it improved the appearence of the page.
It was texted in different browsers, Google Chrome, Microsofe Edge, Safari and Firefox.
I also tested that the links along the top all worked, as well as the social media links at the bottom (these just lead to the homepages as this company doesnt have a facebook or twitter.)
I also used the W3C validator to make sure that my HTML and CSS code was valid and legal. 
The website has been designed so that it is suitable for all customers. I have kept the colour scheme,, layout and text simple and consistent.


## Deployment

My code was uploaded to GitHub and is hosted directly from the master branch. 
If the code has been edited or updated, the changes can be pushed to GitHub by following the steps below:
1- In the terminal, type "git add ." which will add all the updates to the repositary.
2- Type "git commit -m "include message documenting the changes here""
3- You can push the changes to GitHub with "git push origin master", typing in the username and password of the GitHub account.

I received inspiration for this project from visiting Meeple Perk, a baord game cafe in Newcastle. 
The name of the cafe was inspired by The Learning People, who arranged me doing this course.
