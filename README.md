# The Dice People

I created a website for a fictional board game cafe in Whitley Bay. 
The wesite includes a list of events, information on the location and opening times of the cafe and the prices for table and game hire. It also includes a contact form to get in touch.


## UX

The website is aimed at customers and potential customers. It gives basic information about the cafe and uses images to convey that a primary reason to visit is to play board games. 
I have attended a board game cafe locally which does not have a website, so I thought about what kind of things I would want to see if they did have one. I also visited their Facebook Page and had a look at other board game cafe websites which I found on Google. This enabled me to see what kind of information they thought customers found important.
I designed the website to be simple, providing the basic information needed to a potential customer and provide a contact form in case they want to know more.

The website includes the main page giving information to anyone visiting, this clarifies the type of cafe it is, and gives information on upcoming events which may be important to a regular customer who is wanting to check what is happening. 
The about page shows where it is located, when it is open and gives information about the cost of hiring a table or attending events. All of this will help a customer who is intending on visiting. 
Originally the page was going to include a menu, however that seemed like something to add later as we have already told the customer hot drinks, food and alcoholic drinks can be purchased, as well as confirming we provide for vegan and gluten free customers. Instead, I included a contact page where customers can ask questions or book a table. 


## Features to implement in the future

I would add a menu in the future. I would also add a more detailled booking system so a customer can select a date, view availibility and book the table directly (rather than submit a request and wait on a response).
I would link the website up with BoardGameGeek.com showing exactly what games are available to play in the cafe so that customers can view the games we have. 
Also I would also include photos of the games displays and images of inside the cafe. 


## Technologies used

I created the website using HTML5 and CSS3. I also used Bootstrap 4 to style the webpage.
Fonts used were from Google Fonts.
The map was from Google Maps.
Icons used were from Font Awesome.


## Testing

I tested the website using Google Dev Tools to view the page as it would be on various devices. I also tested that the links along the top all worked, as well as the social media links at the bottom (these just lead to the homepages as this company doesnt have a facebook or twitter.)
I also used the W3C validator to make sure that my HTML and CSS code was valid and legal. 


## Deployment

My code was uploaded to GitHub.

I received inspiration for this project from visiting Meeple Perk, a baord game cafe in Newcastle. 
The name of the cafe was inspired by The Learning People, who arranged me doing this course.
